# Pivot
The goal of this project was to make a VR puzzle game that changes the way teleportation typically works in most VR games. I decided that, instead of just letting the player teleport along the floor, we should also let them teleport onto walls and the ceiling as well and gravity should shift with them.

The main focus of this project for me was making the core teleportation feature work and making it as intuitive as possible, it went through a lot of iterations that aren't chronicled here because we were using Unity's version control intitially. That functionmality is mainly found in teleport.c
